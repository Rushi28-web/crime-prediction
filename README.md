# crime-prediction
A Python-based machine learning project that analyzes historical crime data, visualizes patterns through graphs, and predicts the likelihood of specific crime types based on location and time.

Features
Data Visualization – Crime trends displayed using graphs and charts.
Machine Learning – Predicts crime types using algorithms like Random Forest.
Location & Time Analysis – Identifies high-risk areas and times.
Custom Dataset Support – Works with your own crime dataset.

Technologies Used
Pandas & NumPy – Data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning

How to Run
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crime-prediction.git
cd crime-prediction

Install Required Libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:)

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Add the Dataset
Place crime_data.csv in the project folder.

Dataset should include columns like:
mathematica
Latitude, Longitude, Hour, DayOfWeek, Crime_Type

Run the Program
python crime_prediction.py
